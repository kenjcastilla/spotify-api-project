# spotify-api-project
Utilizing Spotify's API to gain insight on habits/analyze data and practice querying APIs.

WARNING: If you don't have a Spotify account, then cloning and running won't work the way you want it to. You can still observe my findings in the notebooks, but you need your own Spotify credentials to play around with the functions in the .py files.

To use:
  
	First, follow directions in "tokens.py" for Spotify authorization.
 	Either (1) Open one of the notebooks ("spotify_track_habits.ipynb", "spotify_manage_playlist-top-recent.ipynb") and run all cells
 	(2) Run "main.py", and see changes in your Spotify library.

Be sure to check your own Spotify playlist to see the changes!
